Built in the former National Biscuit Company factory complex where the Oreo cookie was invented and produced, the complex fills an entire city block bounded by Ninth and Tenth Avenues and 15th and 16th Streets, with a connecting bridge over Tenth Avenue to the adjacent 85 Tenth Avenue building, which was also part of the Nabisco complex but is now separately owned. In addition to the retail concourse, it also provides standard office space for tenants, including media and broadcasting companies such as Oxygen Network, Food Network, MLB.com, EMI Music Publishing and the local New York City cable station NY1. Also, more recently, Google has moved into some of the second, third, and fourth floors along with its subsidiary YouTube on the fifth. ]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[Madison Square Garden (sometimes called MSG or simply The Garden) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. Located between Seventh and Eighth Avenues from 31st to 33rd Streets, it is situated atop Pennsylvania Station (the second railroad station to bear the name). It is the fourth venue to bear the "MSG" name, the first two (1879 and 1890) of which were located on Madison Square, on East 26th Street and Madison Avenue, with the third Madison Square Garden further uptown at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street. The Garden is used for professional basketball and ice hockey, as well as boxing, concerts, ice shows, circuses, and other forms of sports and entertainment. It resides in close geographic proximity to other midtown Manhattan landmarks, including the Empire State Building, Koreatown, and Macy's at Herald Square. It is home to the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League, the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association, and residency to singer-songwriter, Billy Joel.
Opening on February 11, 1968, it is now considered to be the oldest, and most active major sporting facility in the New York City metropolitan area. It is the oldest arena in the National Hockey League and the second-oldest arena in the National Basketball Association. Madison Square Garden is the third-busiest music arena in the world in terms of ticket sales, behind the Manchester Arena and The O2 Arena, both in England. At a total construction cost of approximately $1.1 billion, Madison Square Garden has been ranked as one of the ten most expensive stadium venues ever built. It is part of the Pennsylvania Plaza office and retail complex. Several other operating entities related to the Garden share its name.]]></desc>

		<title><![CDATA[Church of the Village United Methodist Church]]></title>
		<desc><![CDATA[The Church of the Village is the result of a merger in 2005 of three United Methodist churches: All Nations (Iglesia de Todas Las Naciones), Metropolitan-Duane, and Washington Square. This combined congregation meets in the former Metropolitan-Duane United Methodist Church, a Collegiate Gothic sanctuary designed by Louis E. Jallade and built in 1932 as the Metropolitan Temple Church. The building is similar to Broadway Presbyterian Church, built in 1925 on Broadway at 114th Street, which was also designed by Jallade.
Metropolitan-Duane United Methodist Church can trace its roots back to 1833 with the founding of The First Wesleyan Chapel on Vestry Street. Francis Hall and others organized the chapel, which was the first "pewed" Methodist church in New York. The name was later changed to the Central Church, and in 1856 a sanctuary was built at 50 Seventh Avenue, between 13th and 14th Streets. Ulysses S. Grant attended Central Church at this time. After the appointment in 1896 of the Rev. Samuel Parkes Cadman (for whom Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn was named), Central Church was renamed Metropolitan Temple. In 1928 the church burned down, and was replaced by the current building in 1932.
The Duane Street Methodist Episcopal Church, founded in 1797, was absorbed into Metropolitan Temple in 1939, and the combined church was renamed Metropolitan-Duane Methodist Episcopal Church.]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[The Washington Square Arch, more properly called the Washington Arch, is a marble triumphal arch built in 1892 in Washington Square Park in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan in New York City. It celebrates the centennial of George Washington's inauguration as President of the United States in 1789 and forms the grand southern terminus of Fifth Avenue.
Washington Square Arch, constructed of white Tuckahoe marble (Westchester marble), was modeled by Stanford White on the Arc de Triomphe, built in 1806, in Paris (itself modeled on the Arch of Titus). It stands 77 feet (23 m) high. The piers stand 30 feet (9.1 m) apart and the arch opening is 47 feet (14 m) high. The iconography of the Arch centers on images of war and peace. On the frieze are 13 large stars and 42 small stars interspersed with capital "W"s. The spandrels contain figures of Victory. The inscription on the attic story reads:
"Let us raise a standard to which the wise and the honest can repair. The event is in the hand of God."

		<desc><![CDATA[The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, commonly referred to simply as Cooper Union, is a privately funded college located in Cooper Square in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Inspired in 1830 when Peter Cooper learned about the government-supported École Polytechnique in France, Cooper Union was established in 1859.
Cooper Union's Foundation Building is an Italianate brownstone building designed by architect Fred A. Petersen, one of the founders of the American Institute of Architects. It was the first structure in New York City to feature rolled-iron I-beams for structural support; Peter Cooper himself invented and produced these beams.[25] Petersen patented a fire resistant hollow brick tile he used in the building's construction.[26][27] The building was the first in the world to be built with an elevator shaft, because Cooper, in 1853, was confident an elevator would soon be invented.[28] The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961,[29][30] and a New York City Landmark in 1965.[31]]]></desc>

It was built in 1928-30 and was designed by Ralph Walker of the firm of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker as the headquarters of the Western Union Company, a purpose it served until 1973. The building contained offices, an auditorium, cafeteria and gymnasium, classrooms so messengers could continue their education, shops and equipment rooms, along with 70 million feet of cable.
The design of the building shows the influence of German Expressionism, while the detailing is Art Deco. The exterior brick moves from darker shades to lighter ones as the building rises, passing through 19 different colors as it does. Both the interior and exterior of the building, which is now one of the most important Internet hubs in the world were designated New York City landmarks in 1991.]]></desc>

Construction began in 1907 and ended in 1914, marking the end of the City Beautiful movement in New York. William M. Kendall of the noted architectural firm McKim, Mead and White designed the building, which was the first to incorporate a subway station – the Chambers Street station, served by the J Z trains – into its base. Enormously influential in the civic construction of other American cities, its application of Beaux-Arts architecture served as the prototype for the Terminal Tower in Cleveland, and the Wrigley Building in Chicago, in addition to the Seven Sisters of Stalin-era Soviet architecture.]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[The Chrysler Building is an Art Deco style skyscraper in New York City, located on the east side of Manhattan in the Turtle Bay area at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue. At 1,046 feet (319 m), the structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before it was surpassed by the Empire State Building in 1931. It is still the tallest brick building in the world, albeit with an internal steel skeleton. After the destruction of the World Trade Center, it was again the second-tallest building in New York City until December 2007, when the spire was raised on the 1,200-foot (365.8 m) Bank of America Tower, pushing the Chrysler Building into third position. In addition, The New York Times Building, which opened in 2007, is exactly level with the Chrysler Building in height. Both buildings were then pushed into 4th position, when the under construction One World Trade Center surpassed their height.]]></desc>
